Steps to install all-atom
1) download from github (https://github.com/Mingchenchen/AtomicFrustratometer_Results/tree/master/src)
	1) dependencies to install:
		Python libraries (it is adapted to python 3, so install everything in python3) numpy, scipy, matplotlib;
		Pymol (not required to run for visualization only, easier than VMD);
		VMD (not required to run for visualization only); 
		Biopython;
2) Download from Rosetta the academically licensed "Rosetta Software Suite" (https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download).
3) Install Rosetta: https://new.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/install_build/install_build#installing-rosetta
4) Modify one file in job.sh
	1) the directory where rosetta is located, in my case /home/maria/Rosetta
5) In the file Frust_Post_public.py I modified import scipy.io by import scipy, it didn't recognize the library and all the print I put them between ()
6) Once everything is installed, I recommend, create a folder called RunAllAtom and there download the files from this github
7) In the RunAllAtom folder give executable permissions to the job.sh (chmod +x job.sh)
8) To run it, python RunFrustraAllAtom.py PDBID.pdb N_decoys star_pdb end_pdb for example for the structure 1QYS.pdb with 50 decoys: python RunFrustraAllAtom.py 1QYS.pdb 50 1 92
